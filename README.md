FRC 2024 Crescendo

Description:

	This was our first year coding in Java. Our code is a bit of a mess, but we made it work. Hopefully, this can be of some use to someone else. Please be aware that this code is designed for tank drive. If you use another form of drive, then you will need to make changed to the drivetrain.java files and others.

Coding Style:

	Command - Subsystem

Prerequisites:
	
	To run this code, you will need the most recent version of WPILib. Once installed you will also need the Rev Robotics software library. More information on the installation can be found at https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/vscode-overview/3rd-party-libraries.html.

Installation:

	You will likely need to copy the code into the source directory of your WPILib project. I'm afraid I don't know much about the specifics at the moment. You'll likely need to use WPILib's import project command.

Configuration:

	Most of the specific configuration settings can be found in Constants.java. The biggest thing to worry about is the motor controller ids. 

Usage:

	Once you've imported the files to a WPILib project you must build and deploy them. All of this can be done via the three dots in the top right of the WPILib window. More infomation can be found on the official WPILib website that was previously linked.

Final Notes:

	It's not perfect or pretty, but it got the job done. We have published this code under the GNU Public License. The official license is under COPYING.txt per tradition. May this code help another beginner programmer.
